# Generic NPC decision algorithm

This algorithm tries to be as generic as possible, being able to work for any format and game type.

The algorithm tries to implement a NPC-like behavior, using both damage and status moves, and also switching.

To instantiate it:

```ts
const algorithmInstance = new GenericNPCDecisionAlgorithm();
```
